**Self-supervised learning** aims to learn useful representations of input data without relying on human annotations. When trained offline with enormous amounts of unlabeled data, self-supervised models have been found to provide visual representations that are equivalent to or better than supervised models. However, in **continual learning (CL)** circumstances, where data is fed to the model sequentially, their efficacy is drastically diminished.

### Project Overview

This study tackles the challenging problem of continually learning usable representations when input data arrives sequentially. By utilizing **distillation** and **proofreading**, the project aims to prevent severe forgetfulness and maintain model performance in continual learning scenarios.

### Key Features

- **Distillation**: Adds a prediction layer that forces current representation vectors to match frozen learned representations.
- **Proofreading with Memory**: Implements an effective selection memory to revisit and refine previous data.
- **Continual Learning**: Enables the model to learn sequentially without significant performance degradation.

### Applications

- **Computer Vision**: Improves representation learning for vision tasks in dynamic environments.
- **Unlabeled Data**: Leverages self-supervised learning to handle large-scale, unlabeled datasets effectively.

### Skills and Technologies

- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Core methodology for representation learning.
- **Continual Learning (CL)**: Focused on sequential data processing.
- **Distillation**: Ensures alignment of current and past representations.
- **Machine Learning**: Powers the overall learning and optimization process.

This project demonstrates the potential of combining distillation and replay techniques to address the challenges of continual self-supervised learning, paving the way for more robust and adaptive models.
