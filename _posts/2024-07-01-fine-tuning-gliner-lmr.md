**Named Entity Recognition (NER)** is an essential task in natural language processing (NLP) for identifying key information within text, such as locations, organizations, and people. This project focuses on fine-tuning **GLiNER**, a pre-trained model specifically designed for NER, to enhance its performance in **Location Mention Recognition (LMR)**.

### Project Goals

The primary objective is to improve the detection and classification of location entities in user-generated content, such as social media posts. This capability is critical for tasks like disaster response and other location-based applications.

### Key Features

- **Fine-Tuning GLiNER**: Enhances the model's ability to recognize and classify location mentions.
- **Focus on User-Generated Content**: Optimized for noisy and informal text, such as social media posts.
- **Critical Applications**: Supports disaster response and other location-based tasks by improving location entity recognition.

### Skills and Technologies

- **Generative AI**: Utilized for model fine-tuning and optimization.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Core task for identifying location mentions.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Powers the underlying text analysis.

This project demonstrates the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained models like GLiNER to address specific challenges in NER, particularly for location-based tasks in real-world scenarios.
