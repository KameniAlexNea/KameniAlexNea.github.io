**GraphRAG-Tagger** is an end-to-end lightweight toolkit for extracting topics from PDFs and visualizing their connections using graphs.

### Why Use GraphRAG-Tagger?

If you're transitioning from traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to GraphRAG, defining interactions between chunks is crucial. GraphRAG-Tagger automates this process by:

- Extracting topics from PDFs.
- Constructing topic similarity graphs.
- Making retrieval more structured and context-aware.

### Key Features

- Automates topic extraction from PDFs.
- Visualizes topic connections using graph structures.
- Facilitates the transition from RAG to GraphRAG.
- Enhances retrieval workflows with structured and context-aware interactions.

### Skills and Technologies

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Supports advanced retrieval workflows.
- **GraphRAG**: Enables structured and graph-based retrieval.
- **CI/CD**: Designed with continuous integration and delivery in mind.

GraphRAG-Tagger is an essential toolkit for developers and researchers looking to enhance their retrieval systems by leveraging graph-based approaches. Simplify your transition to GraphRAG today!
