The people of Malawi have faced numerous natural disasters and climatic shocks in recent years, such as droughts, floods, and landslides. These events, compounded by the impacts of Covid-19 and other global issues, have severely affected the health and well-being of most Malawians. Rural areas, where more than 80% of the population resides, have been particularly hard-hit.

### Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging **transformer-based object detection models** to address gaps in accurately mapping flood extents and corresponding damages using satellite imagery. Traditional algorithms often miss grass-thatched roofs in rural areas, which are common in Malawi. By using advanced object detection techniques, this project aims to improve the identification of affected populations and buildings.

### Key Features

- **Transformer-Based Models**: Utilizes state-of-the-art transformer architectures for object detection.
- **Satellite Imagery Analysis**: Focuses on mapping flood extents and damages in rural Malawi.
- **Improved Accuracy**: Addresses gaps in detecting traditional grass-thatched roofs and other rural structures.

### Skills and Technologies

- **Computer Vision**: Core technology for analyzing satellite imagery.
- **Machine Learning**: Powers the detection and classification algorithms.
- **Object Detection**: Focused on identifying buildings and affected populations.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes advanced transformer models for enhanced accuracy.

This project highlights the potential of transformer-based object detection models in addressing real-world challenges, particularly in disaster response and rural development contexts.
