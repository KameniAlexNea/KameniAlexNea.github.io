# Alex Kameni, ML Eng

Passionate about data science and continuously striving for improvement through best practices and collaboration. Always eager to learn and innovate in the field of data science and machine learning.

## About Me

Graduated with a master's degree in Complex Systems Engineering, 2022, specializing in Machine Learning and Data Science, from CY Cergy Paris University. My master's research at the ETIS Laboratory of ENSEA focused on Data Incremental Learning for self-supervised models in computer vision. 

Additionally, I hold an engineering degree in Computer Science from the Polytechnic School of Yaound√©, Cameroon. My current role as a Data Scientist at Ivalua has further enhanced my knowledge and skills in data science and machine learning. I have contributed to two research projects, which were the subjects of my defenses at the Polytechnic School and ENSEA.
