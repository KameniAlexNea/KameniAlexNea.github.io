# **Alex Kameni**  
**Machine Learning Engineer | Data Scientist | AI Researcher**  

Passionate about leveraging data science and machine learning to solve complex problems, I thrive at the intersection of innovation and practical implementation. With a strong academic foundation and hands-on industry experience, I specialize in developing scalable AI solutions—from self-supervised learning to NLP and computer vision. My collaborative mindset and dedication to continuous learning drive me to push boundaries in both research and real-world applications.  


## **About Me**  

I hold a **Master’s in Complex Systems Engineering** (2022) from **CY Cergy Paris University**, specializing in **Machine Learning and Data Science**, where my research at **ETIS Laboratory (ENSEA)** focused on **continual learning for self-supervised computer vision models**. Prior to this, I earned an **Engineering Degree in Computer Science** from the **Polytechnic School of Yaoundé, Cameroon**, completing thesis projects on cutting-edge ML topics.  

Currently, as a **Data Scientist at Ivalua**, I enhance **AI-driven invoice processing** by integrating **domain-specific language models** and **multimodal AI (LayoutLM)**. My work has optimized data pipelines, improved model efficiency, and accelerated AI adoption across the organization.  

Beyond my professional role, I actively contribute to **open-source AI projects**, with research and projects spanning **natural language processing, computer vision, self-supervised and continual learning, AI agent workflows, and retrieval-augmented generation**-showcasing my versatility and commitment to impactful technology.
