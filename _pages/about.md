# Alex Kameni, ML Eng

Driven by a passion for data science and machine learning, I constantly seek opportunities to innovate, learn, and implement best practices. My collaborative spirit and commitment to continual improvement have fueled my growth in both research and applied domains.

## About Me

I hold a Master’s degree in Complex Systems Engineering (2022), specializing in Machine Learning and Data Science from CY Cergy Paris University. My master's research at the ETIS Laboratory of ENSEA explored data incremental learning for self-supervised computer vision models, addressing challenges in continual learning.

Additionally, I earned an engineering degree in Computer Science from the Polytechnic School of Yaoundé, Cameroon. My academic journey included in-depth research and two defended projects on cutting-edge topics in machine learning.

Currently, as a Data Scientist at Ivalua, I focus on enhancing invoice data capture and domain-specific language model integration. I’ve introduced transformative solutions like deploying LayoutLM for multimodal data comprehension, improving resource efficiency, and optimizing data pipelines. My contributions have significantly streamlined operations and advanced AI adoption within the organization.

Beyond work, I’m actively involved in projects spanning African history, NLP, computer vision, and self-supervised learning, showcasing my versatile skill set and commitment to impactful solutions.
