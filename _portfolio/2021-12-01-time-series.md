**Project: Time Series Generation of Financial Data**

**Language:** Python

**Tasks:**

1. **Implement Losses:** Developing and applying loss functions suitable for financial time series data.
2. **Implement Generative Models:** Utilizing Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to generate synthetic financial data.
3. **LU-factorization:** Implementing and applying LU decomposition for matrix factorization in the context of financial data.
4. **Gaussian Model:** Developing and refining Gaussian models for noise and data generation.

**Files and Notebooks:**

- Various Jupyter notebooks (e.g., `gan_v1.ipynb`, `vae.ipynb`) for developing and testing generative models.
- Python scripts (e.g., `main.py`, `train.py`) for implementing core functionalities.
- Configuration files (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `env.yml`) for setting up the environment and dependencies.
