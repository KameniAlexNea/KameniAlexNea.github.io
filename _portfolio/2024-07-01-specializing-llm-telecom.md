### Project Description: Enhancing Telecom Knowledge Tasks with Specialized LLMs

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in general text understanding and generation. However, their effectiveness can be limited when applied to highly specialized domains like telecommunications without specific adaptation. This project explores the specialization of LLMs to improve their performance on tasks requiring deep telecom industry knowledge.

#### Objective

The primary goal is to adapt and optimize a pre-trained Large Language Model, specifically Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, for telecom-specific question-answering tasks. This involves fine-tuning the model on a specialized dataset to enhance its accuracy and relevance within the telecom domain.

#### Key Features

- **Domain Specialization**: Focuses on adapting a general-purpose LLM (Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct) to the specific nuances and terminology of the telecommunications sector.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Employs supervised fine-tuning techniques using a targeted dataset to improve the model's ability to handle telecom-related queries.
- **Specialized Dataset**: Utilizes the TeleQnA competition dataset, which consists of multiple-choice questions specifically related to telecommunications, ensuring domain relevance.
- **Performance Optimization**: Aims to achieve measurable improvements in the model's performance (e.g., accuracy) on telecom knowledge tasks compared to the base model.

**Project Objectives:**

1. **Fine-tune Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct on Telecom Knowledge:**
   - Train and optimize the Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct model to accurately respond to telecom-specific questions.
   - Leverage advanced training techniques such as **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for efficient model tuning, along with 4-bit quantization to handle large-scale data while reducing memory footprint.

2. **Overcome Common Challenges:**
   - Address the complexities of telecom-specific terminology and concepts.
   - Reduce hallucinations common in LLMs when faced with domain-specific queries.
   - Ensure responses are accurate and can be justified using telecom knowledge.

#### Methodology

The fine-tuning process included several key steps, leveraging efficient training techniques and domain-specific adjustments to ensure optimal model performance:

1. **Data Understanding and Preparation:**
   - The project utilized the **TeleQnA** dataset, ensuring the text data was properly structured and relevant for telecom knowledge tasks.
   - Data preprocessing was performed using custom utilities to clean and prepare telecom text for model consumption.

2. **Model Selection and Fine-Tuning:**
   - **Model Choice:** Selected a suitable base LLM (Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct) known for its strong instruction-following capabilities, manageable size, and support for **RoPE Scaling** for extended context length.
   - **Model Fine-Tuning:**
     - Implemented parameter-efficient tuning using **QLoRA**, targeting specific layers for low-rank adaptation such as `q_proj`, `k_proj`, and `v_proj` modules, which are critical for understanding attention in telecom-specific contexts.

     - Utilized **gradient checkpointing** and memory-efficient techniques like **4-bit quantization** to minimize GPU memory consumption, making the process viable for longer sequences.

3. **Training Setup:**
   - **Training Configuration:**
     - Used **SFTTrainer** from the `trl` library to manage the fine-tuning process. This allowed for flexible configurations with customized **sequence length**, **packing** strategy, and **multi-GPU support** for telecom-specific fine-tuning.
     - Batch sizes and learning rates were optimized based on the constraints of the telecom dataset, using **AdamW optimizer with 8-bit precision** to balance performance and memory efficiency.

4. **Mitigating Hallucinations and Fabrications:**
   - Focused on limiting fabricated responses by employing **fact-checking mechanisms** and reinforcement-based techniques to penalize hallucinations during the training process.
   - Integrated post-processing steps, validating output against a trusted telecom knowledge base to ensure factual consistency.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance on a held-out test set from the TeleQnA data or similar telecom-specific benchmarks.
   - Analyze the results to understand the impact of fine-tuning on the model's domain-specific knowledge and reasoning abilities.
