**Project Title: Specializing Large Language Models for Telecom Applications**

**Project Overview:**

Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in text generation, comprehension, and interaction. While their integration into various sectors has been impressive, the telecommunications industry has seen limited adoption. This project aims to bridge that gap by enhancing the performance of LLMs on telecom-specific knowledge using the TeleQnA dataset. The competition focused on improving the accuracy of Falcon 7.5B and Phi-2 models in answering multiple-choice questions related to different telecom knowledge domains.

**Project Objectives:**
